Prompt_Length           1.000000           0.050476
Cosine_Similarity       0.050476           1.000000

The output of the python script is a correlation matrix between Prompt_Length and Cosine_Similarity. 
The matrix shows that there is a weak positive correlation between the length of the prompt and the cosine similarity score. 
This means that as the length of the prompt increases, the cosine similarity score also increases slightly. 
However, the correlation is not strong enough to make any definitive conclusions.
For the current stage, we only know the length of the input may influence the answers to some extent.
In the next steps, we will try to find out how exactly different working impact the output.
